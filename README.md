[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4308518.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4308518)

This is a fork of [openInjMoldSim](https://github.com/krebeljk/openInjMoldSim) for amorphous polymer volumetric relaxation modeling.  

This fork and the cases are described in a [The cooling rate dependence of the specific volume in amorphous
plastic injection molding](https://rdcu.be/but3t).

This code is not part of OpenFOAM. It only uses OpenFOAM v3.0.1. To learn about OpenFOAM see [openfoam.org](https://openfoam.org/), unofficial wiki
[openfoamwiki.net](https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Main_Page) and the community forum
[cfd-online.com](https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam/).

## Getting Started

An OpenFOAM 3.0.1 installation is required to run the code.

Run `wmake` in the [`openInjMoldDyMSim`](applications/solvers/multiphase/openInjMoldSim/openInjMoldDyMSim) directory.

Run `Allwmake` in `/tutorials/externalWallHeatFluxTemperatureP/` to include the pressure dependent thermal boundary condition.  

Run `AllRun` in the [`tutorials`](/tutorials/) directory to run the example simulation. Then run `paraFoam` in the case directory to view the results.

## Functionality

* Compressible, non-isothermal, laminar cavity flow.
* Tait equation of state with viscoelastic volume relaxation.
* Cross-WLF viscosity model.
* Elastic solidification.
* Cases model a compliant mold wall implemented through dynamic mesh and a coded boundary condition.

## Feedback

Any feedback is apreciated - krebeljk()gmail.com.
